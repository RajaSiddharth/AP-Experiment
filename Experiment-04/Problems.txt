                    Problem 1

Given two strings s and goal, return true if and only if s can become goal after some number of shifts on s.
A shift on s consists of moving the leftmost character of s to the rightmost position.
For example, if s = "abcde", then it will be "bcdea" after one shift. 

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "cdeab"
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: s = "abcde", goal = "abced"
Output: false
 

Constraints:
1 <= s.length, goal.length <= 100
s and goal consist of lowercase English letters.

                    Problem 2

Given two strings needle and haystack, return the index of the first occurrence of needle in haystack, or -1 if needle is not part of haystack.

Example 1:
Input: haystack = "sadbutsad", needle = "sad"
Output: 0
Explanation: "sad" occurs at index 0 and 6.
The first occurrence is at index 0, so we return 0.

Example 2:
Input: haystack = "leetcode", needle = "leeto"
Output: -1
Explanation: "leeto" did not occur in "leetcode", so we return -1.
