                    Problem 1

Given the roots of two binary trees p and q, write a function to check if they are the same or not.
Two binary trees are considered the same if they are structurally identical, and the nodes have the same value.

Example 1:
Input: p = [1,2,3], q = [1,2,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: p = [1,2], q = [1,null,2]
Output: false

Example 3:
Input: p = [1,2,1], q = [1,1,2]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in both trees is in the range [0, 100].
-104 <= Node.val <= 104

                    Problem 2

Given the root of a binary tree, check whether it is a mirror of itself (i.e., symmetric around its center).

Example 1:
Input: root = [1,2,2,3,4,4,3]
Output: true

Example 2:
Input: root = [1,2,2,null,3,null,3]
Output: false

Constraints:
The number of nodes in the tree is in the range [1, 1000].
-100 <= Node.val <= 100
