/*      Problem 2
You are given two strings s and t.
String t is generated by random shuffling string s and then add one more letter at a random position.
Return the letter that was added to t.

Example 1:
Input: s = "abcd", t = "abcde"
Output: "e"
Explanation: 'e' is the letter that was added.

Example 2:
Input: s = "", t = "y"
Output: "y"

Constraints:
0 <= s.length <= 1000
t.length == s.length + 1
s and t consist of lowercase English letters.
